	Abstract = {Motivation: Increasingly, biological processes are being studied through time series of RNA expression data collected for large numbers of genes. Because common processes may unfold at varying rates in different experiments or individuals, methods are needed that will allow corresponding expression states in different time series to be mapped to one another.Results: We present implementations of time warping algorithms applicable to RNA and protein expression data and demonstrate their application to published yeast RNA expression time series. Programs executing two warping algorithms are described, a simple warping algorithm and an interpolative algorithm, along with programs that generate graphics that visually present alignment information. We show time warping to be superior to simple clustering at mapping corresponding time states. We document the impact of statistical measurement noise and sample size on the quality of time alignments, and present issues related to statistical assessment of alignment quality through alignment scores. We also discuss directions for algorithm improvement including development of multiple time series alignments and possible applications to causality searches and non-temporal processes (concentration warping).Availability: Academic implementations of alignment programs genewarp and genewarpi and the graphics generation programs grphwarp and grphwarpi are available as Win32 system DOS box executables on our web site along with documentation on their use. The publicly available data on which they were demonstrated may be found at http://genome-www.stanford.edu/cellcycle/.

@article{Bozdech2003,
	Abstract = {Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most burdensome form of human malaria, affecting 200-300 million individuals per year worldwide. The recently sequenced genome of P. falciparum revealed over 5,400 genes, of which 60\% encode proteins of unknown function. Insights into the biochemical function and regulation of these genes will provide the foundation for future drug and vaccine development efforts toward eradication of this disease. By analyzing the complete asexual intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC) transcriptome of the HB3 strain of P. falciparum, we demonstrate that at least 60\% of the genome is transcriptionally active during this stage. Our data demonstrate that this parasite has evolved an extremely specialized mode of transcriptional regulation that produces a continuous cascade of gene expression, beginning with genes corresponding to general cellular processes, such as protein synthesis, and ending with Plasmodium-specific functionalities, such as genes involved in erythrocyte invasion. The data reveal that genes contiguous along the chromosomes are rarely coregulated, while transcription from the plastid genome is highly coregulated and likely polycistronic. Comparative genomic hybridization between HB3 and the reference genome strain (3D7) was used to distinguish between genes not expressed during the IDC and genes not detected because of possible sequence variations. Genomic differences between these strains were found almost exclusively in the highly antigenic subtelomeric regions of chromosomes. The simple cascade of gene regulation that directs the asexual development of P. falciparum is unprecedented in eukaryotic biology. The transcriptome of the IDC resembles a "just-in-time" manufacturing process whereby induction of any given gene occurs once per cycle and only at a time when it is required. These data provide to our knowledge the first comprehensive view of the timing of transcription throughout the intraerythrocytic development of P. falciparum and provide a resource for the identification of new chemotherapeutic and vaccine candidates},

@article{Liu2010,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Time-course gene expression datasets provide important insights into dynamic aspects of biological processes, such as circadian rhythms, cell cycle and organ development. In a typical microarray time-course experiment, measurements are obtained at each time point from multiple replicate samples. Accurately recovering the gene expression patterns from experimental observations is made challenging by both measurement noise and variation among replicates' rates of development. Prior work on this topic has focused on inference of expression patterns assuming that the replicate times are synchronized. We develop a statistical approach that simultaneously infers both (i) the underlying (hidden) expression profile for each gene, as well as (ii) the biological time for each individual replicate. Our approach is based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) combined with a probabilistic model that accounts for uncertainty about the biological development time of each replicate.Results: We apply GPR with uncertain measurement times to a microarray dataset of mRNA expression for the hair-growth cycle in mouse back skin, predicting both profile shapes and biological times for each replicate. The predicted time shifts show high consistency with independently obtained morphological estimates of relative development. We also show that the method systematically reduces prediction error on out-of-sample data, significantly reducing the mean squared error in a cross-validation study.Availability: Matlab code for GPR with uncertain time shifts is available at http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Code/GPRTimeshift/Contact: ihler\@ics.uci.edu},

	Abstract = {Time course gene microarray is an important tool to identify genes with differential expressions over time. Traditional analysis of variance (ANOVA) type of longitudinal investigation may not be applicable because of irregular time intervals and possible missingness due to contamination in microarray experiments. Functional principal components analysis is proposed to test hypotheses in the change of the mean curves. A permutation test under a mild assumption is used to make the method more robust. The proposed method outperforms the recently developed extraction of differential gene expression and a 2-way mixed effects ANOVA under reasonable gene expression models in simulation. Real data on transcriptional profiles of blood cells microarray from treated and untreated individuals were used to illustrate this method.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: The expressions of many genes associated with certain periodic biological and cell cycle processes such as circadian rhythm regulation are known to be rhythmic. Identification of the genes whose time course expressions are synchronized to certain periodic biological process may help to elucidate the molecular basis of many diseases, and these gene products may in turn represent drug targets relevant to those diseases. RESULTS: We propose in this paper a statistical framework based on a shape-invariant model together with a false discovery rate (FDR) procedure for identifying periodically expressed genes based on microarray time-course gene expression data and a set of known periodically expressed guide genes. We applied the proposed methods to the alpha-factor, cdc15 and cdc28 synchronized yeast cell cycle data sets and identified a total of 1010 cell-cycle-regulated genes at a FDR of 0.5\% in at least one of the three data sets analyzed, including 89 (86\%) of 104 known periodic transcripts. We also identified 344 and 201 circadian rhythmic genes in vivo in mouse heart and liver tissues with FDR of 10 and 2.5\%, respectively. Our results also indicate that the shape-invariant model fits the data well and provides estimate of the common shape function and the relative phases for these periodically regulated genes},

@article{Minas2011,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Time course gene expression experiments are performed to study time-varying changes in mRNA levels of thousands of genes. Statistical methods from functional data analysis (FDA) have recently gained popularity for modelling and exploring such time courses. Each temporal profile is treated as the realization of a smooth function of time, or curve, and the inferred curve becomes the basic unit of statistical analysis. The task of identifying genes with differential temporal profiles then consists of detecting statistically significant differences between curves, where such differences are commonly quantified by computing the area between the curves or the l2 distance.Results: We propose a general test statistic for detecting differences between gene curves, which only depends on a suitably chosen distance measure between them. The test makes use of a distance-based variance decomposition and generalizes traditional MANOVA tests commonly used for vectorial observations. We also introduce the visual l2 distance, which is shown to capture shape-related differences in gene curves and is robust against time shifts, which would otherwise inflate the traditional l2 distance. Other shape-related distances, such as the curvature, may carry biological significance. We have assessed the comparative performance of the test on realistically simulated datasets and applied it to human immune cell responses to bacterial infection over time.Availability: R scripts are freely available for download at http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/~gmontana/dbf.htm.Contact: g.montana\@imperial.ac.ukSupplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{Sohn2009,
	Abstract = {Time-course microarray experiments are widely used to study the temporal profiles of gene expression. Storey et al. (2005) developed a method for analyzing time-course microarray studies that can be applied to discovering genes whose expression trajectories change over time within a single biological group, or those that follow different time trajectories among multiple groups. They estimated the expression trajectories of each gene using natural cubic splines under the null (no time-course) and alternative (time-course) hypotheses, and used a goodness of fit test statistic to quantify the discrepancy. The null distribution of the statistic was approximated through a bootstrap method. Gene expression levels in microarray data are often complicatedly correlated. An accurate type I error control adjusting for multiple testing requires the joint null distribution of test statistics for a large number of genes. For this purpose, permutation methods have been widely used because of computational ease and their intuitive interpretation.},

	Abstract = {Data in many experiments arises as curves and therefore it is natural to use a curve as a basic unit in the analysis, which is in terms of functional data analysis (FDA). Functional curves are encountered when units are observed over time. Although the whole function curve itself is not observed, a sufficiently large number of evaluations, as is common with modern recording equipment, is assumed to be available. In this article, we consider the statistical inference for the mean functions in the two samples problem drawn from functional data sets, in which we assume that functional curves are observed, that is, we consider the test if these two groups of curves have the same mean functional curve when the two groups of curves without noise are observed. The L 2-norm based and bootstrap-based test statistics are proposed. It is shown that the proposed methodology is flexible. Simulation study and real-data examples are used to illustrate our techniques.},
